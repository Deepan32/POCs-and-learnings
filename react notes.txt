1. Use State()
    Can be used in function components and not in class components.
    Hooks execute in same order.
    Can't be used in if statement().
    Can't be nested it has to be in top level.
    const [count,setcount]= useState(initial value)// runs everytime use as function runs once
    const [count,setcount] = useState()=>{}
